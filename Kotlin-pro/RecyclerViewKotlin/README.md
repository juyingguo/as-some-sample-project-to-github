Android RecyclerView Sample (Kotlin)
====================================

This application implements a RecyclerView in Kotlin with ListAdapter, onClickListener 
and Headers. If you are looking for a simpler sample, look at the RecyclerViewSimple sample
in the directory.


Introduction
------------

Sample demonstrating the use of [RecyclerView][1] to layout elements with a
[LinearLayoutManager][2].

[RecyclerView][1] can display large datasets that can be scrolled
efficiently by recycling a limited number of views. [ListAdapter][3] is used to 
efficiently compute diffs when items are added/removed from the list. Click listeners can be
defined when [ViewHolder][4] views are instantiated.
